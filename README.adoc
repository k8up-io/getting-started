= Getting Started with K8up on Exoscale SKS

One of the most common questions we got from companies moving to Kubernetes has always had to do with backups: how can we ensure that the information in our pods and services can be quickly and safely restored in case of problems?

This situation is so common that we https://vshn.ch/[VSHN] decided to tackle it with our own Kubernetes operator for backups, which we called https://k8up.io/[**K8up**].

[NOTE]

== What is K8up?

K8up (pronounced "/keɪtæpp/" or simply "ketchup") is a Kubernetes operator distributed via a Helm chart, compatible with https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift] and plain Kubernetes. It allows cluster operators to:

* Backup all PVCs marked as `ReadWriteMany` or with a specific annotation.
* Perform individual, on-demand backups.
* Schedule backups to be executed on a regular basis.
* Schedule archivals (for example to AWS Glacier), usually executed in longer intervals.
* Perform "Application Aware" backups, containing the output of any tool capable of writing to `stdout`.
* Check the backup repository for its integrity.
* Prune old backups from a repository.
* Based on top of https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Restic], it can save backups in Amazon S3 buckets, Minio, or https://www.exoscale.com/object-storage/[Exoscale Object Storage] (which we'll use in this tutorial.)

K8up is written in https://golang.org/[Go] and is an open source project https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up[hosted in GitHub].

== Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to backup an https://www.exoscale.com/sks/[Exoscale SKS] cluster. We are going to deploy https://mariadb.com/[MariaDB] and https://wordpress.org/[WordPress] on this cluster, and create a blog post in our new website. Later we're going to "deface" it, so that we can safely restore it later. Through this process, you are going to learn more about K8up and its capabilities.

=== Requirements

This tutorial has been tested in both Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) and macOS (10.15 Catalina.) Please install the following software packages before starting:

* The `kubectl` command.
* https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform].
* The https://restic.net/[Restic] backup application.
* The latest version of the https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/tools/exoscale-command-line-interface/[Exoscale CLI].
* https://helm.sh/[Helm], required to install K8up in your cluster.
* https://k9scli.io/[k9s] to display the contents of our clusters on the terminal.
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq], a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

IMPORTANT: You also need to https://portal.exoscale.com/login[login] to your Exoscale account (or https://portal.exoscale.com/register[register] a new one if you haven't already), and retrieve your API secret and API key!

== Tutorial

It consists of six steps to be executed in sequence:

. <<step_1, Setting up the cluster>>.
. <<step_2, Creating a blog>>.
. <<step_3, Backing up the blog>>.
. <<step_4, Restoring the contents of the backup>>.
. <<step_5, Scheduling regular backups>>.
. <<step_6, Cleaning up>>.

Let's get started!

[[step_1]]
=== Setting up the cluster

NOTE: The operations of this step can be executed at once using the `scripts/1_setup.sh` script.

. Start your Exoscale SKS cluster (this step can take up to 4 minutes to complete):
* `cd scripts && terraform init && terraform apply -auto-approve`

IMPORTANT: Before running this command, make sure that you have exported the `EXOSCALE_API_SECRET` and `EXOSCALE_API_KEY` corresponding to your account as environment variables.

[start=2]
. Export your `KUBECONFIG` from Exoscale:
* `exo sks kubeconfig K8s-getting-started user -z ch-gva-2 --group system:masters > exoscale-sks.kubeconfig && cd ..`

. Set the kubeconfig context:
* `export KUBECONFIG="./scripts/exoscale-sks.kubeconfig"`

. Wait around 5 minutes for your cluster to be ready.

. Create all required secrets and passwords into the cluster:
* `kubectl apply -k secrets`
* `echo -n $EXOSCALE_API_KEY > ./username.txt`
* `echo -n $EXOSCALE_API_SECRET > ./password.txt`
* `kubectl create secret generic backup-credentials --from-file=./username.txt  --from-file=./password.txt`

. Install MariaDB in your cluster:
* `kubectl apply -k mariadb`

. Install WordPress:
* `kubectl apply -k wordpress`

. Install K8up:
* `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up/releases/download/v1.2.0/k8up-crd.yaml`
* `helm repo add appuio https://charts.appuio.ch`
* `helm repo update`
* `helm install k8up appuio/k8up --namespace k8up-operator --create-namespace`

After finishing all these steps, check that everything is running; the easiest way is to launch `k9s` and leave it running in its own terminal window, and of course you can use the usual `kubectl get pods`.

TIP: In `k9s` you can easily delete a pod by going to the "Pods" view (type kbd:[:], write `pods` at the prompt and hit kbd:[Enter]), selecting the pod to delete with the arrow keys, and hitting the kbd:[CTRL+D] key shortcut.

[[step_2]]
=== Viewing WordPress on a browser

NOTE: The operations of this step can be executed at once using the `scripts/2_browser.sh` script.

. Open WordPress in your default browser with the "EXTERNAL-IP" provided by the `kubectl get services` command, running in port 8080. You should see the WordPress installation wizard appearing on your browser window.

==== Setting up the new blog

Follow these instructions in the WordPress installation wizard to create your blog:

. Select your language from the list and click the btn:[Continue] button.
. Fill the form to create new blog.
. Create a user `admin`.
. Copy the random password shown, or use your own password.
. Click the btn:[Install WordPress] button.

.WordPress installer
image::wordpress-install.png[]

[start=6]
. Log in to the WordPress console using the user and password.
* Create one or many new blog posts, for example using pictures from https://unsplash.com/[Unsplash].

. Enter some text or generate some random text using a https://lipsum.com/[Lorem ipsum generator].
. Click on the "Document" tab.
. Add the image as "Featured image".
. Click "Publish" and see the new blog post on the site.

[[step_3]]
=== Backing up the blog

NOTE: The operations of this step can be executed at once using the `scripts/3_backup.sh` script.

To trigger a backup, use the command `kubectl apply -f k8up/backup.yaml`. You can see the job in the "Jobs" section of `k9s`.

If you look at the Exoscale Object Storage browser window, there should be now a "backups" bucket that appeared out of nowhere. That's your backup repository in Restic format!

==== How does K8up work?

K8up runs Restic in the background to perform its job. It will automatically backup the following:

. All PVCs in the cluster with the `ReadWriteMany` attribute.
. All PVCs in the cluster with the `k8up.syn.tools/backup: "true"` annotation.

The PVC definition below shows how to add the required annotation for K8up to do its job.

[source,yaml]
....
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pvc
  labels:
    app: wordpress
  annotations:
    k8up.syn.tools/backup: "true"
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
....

Just like any other Kubernetes object, K8up uses YAML files to describe every single action: backups, restores, archival, etc. The most important part of the YAML files used by K8up is the `backend` object:

[source,yaml]
....
backend:
  repoPasswordSecretRef:
    name: backup-repo
    key: password
  s3:
    endpoint: https://sos-ch-gva-2.exo.io
    bucket: backups
    accessKeyIDSecretRef:
      name: backup-credentials
      key: username
    secretAccessKeySecretRef:
      name: backup-credentials
      key: password
....

This object specifies two major keys:

* `repoPasswordSecretRef` contains the reference to the secret that contains the Restic password. This is used to open, read and write to the backup repository.
* `s3` specifies the location and credentials of the storage where the Restic backup is located. The only valid option at this moment is an AWS S3 compatible location, such as the Exoscale Object Storage in our case.

[[step_4]]
=== Restoring a backup

NOTE: The operations of this step can be executed at once using the `scripts/4_restore.sh` script.

Let's pretend now that an attacker has gained access to your blog: we will remove all blog posts and images from the WordPress installation and empty the trash.

.Defaced WordPress site!
image::wordpress-defaced.png[]

Oh noes! But don't worry: thanks to K8up you can bring your old blog back in a few minutes.

There are many ways to restore Restic backups, for example locally (useful for debugging or inspection) and remotely (on PVCs or S3 buckets, for example.)

==== Restoring locally

To restore using Restic, set these variables (in a Unix-based system; for Windows, the commands are different):

[source,bash]
....
export KUBECONFIG="./scripts/exoscale-sks.kubeconfig"
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=s3:https://sos-ch-gva-2.exo.io/backups-getting-started-repo/
export RESTIC_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$EXOSCALE_API_KEY
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$EXOSCALE_API_SECRET
....

NOTE: You can create these variables simply running `source scripts/environment.sh`.

With these variables in your environment, run the command `restic snapshots` to see the list of backups, and `restic restore XXXXX --target ~/restore` to trigger a restore, where XXXXX is one of the IDs appearing in the results of the snapshots command.

==== Restoring the WordPress PVC

K8up is able to restore data directly on specified PVCs. Use the following command: `kubectl apply -f k8up/restore-wordpress.yaml`

Use the `kubectl get pods` commands to see when your restore job has finished.

TIP: If you use the `kubectl get pods --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp` command to order the pods in descending age order; at the bottom of the list you will see the restore job pod.

==== Restoring the MariaDB pod

In the case of the MariaDB pod, we have used a `backupcommand` annotation. This means that we have to "pipe" the contents of the backup into the `mysql` command of the pod, so that the information can be restored.

Follow these steps to restore the database:

. Retrieve the ID of the MariaDB snapshot:
+
`restic snapshots --json --latest 1 --path /default-mariadb | jq -r '.[0].id'`

. Save the contents of the backup locally:
+
`restic dump SNAPSHOT_ID /default-mariadb > backup.sql`

. Get the name of the MariaDB pod:
+
`kubectl get pods | grep mariadb | awk '{print $1}'`

. Copy the backup into the MariaDB pod:
+
`kubectl cp backup.sql MARIADB_POD:/`

. Get a shell to the MariaDB pod:
+
`kubectl exec -it MARIADB_POD -- /bin/bash`

. Execute the `mysql` command in the MariaDB pod to restore the database:
+
`mysql -uroot -p"${MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD}" < /backup.sql`

Now refresh your WordPress browser window and you should see the previous state of the WordPress installation restored, working and looking as expected!

[[step_5]]
=== Scheduling regular backups

NOTE: The operations of this step can be executed at once using the `scripts/5_schedule.sh` script.

Instead of performing backups manually, you can also set a schedule for backups. This requires specifying the schedule in `cron` format.

[source,yaml]
....
backup:
  schedule: '*/2 * * * *'    # backup every 2 minutes
  keepJobs: 4
  promURL: https://sos-ch-gva-2.exo.io
....

TIP: Use https://crontab.guru/[crontab.guru] to help you set up complex schedule formats in `cron` syntax.

The schedule can also specify `archive` and `check` tasks to be executed regularly.

[source,yaml]
....
archive:
  schedule: '0 0 1 * *'       # archive every week
  restoreMethod:
    s3:
      endpoint: https://sos-ch-gva-2.exo.io
      bucket: archive
      accessKeyIDSecretRef:
        name: backup-credentials
        key: username
      secretAccessKeySecretRef:
        name: backup-credentials
        key: password
check:
  schedule: '0 1 * * 1'      # monthly check
  promURL: https://sos-ch-gva-2.exo.io
....

Run the `kubectl apply -f k8up/schedule.yaml` command. This will setup an automatic schedule to backup the PVCs every 5 minutes (for minutes that are divisors of 5).

Wait for at most 2 minutes, and run the `restic snapshots` to see more backups piling up in the repository.

TIP: Running the `watch restic snapshots` command will give you a live console with your current snapshots on a terminal window, updated every 2 seconds.

[[step_6]]
=== Cleaning up the cluster

NOTE: The operations of this step can be executed at once using the `scripts/6_stop.sh` script.

When you are done with this tutorial, just execute the `terraform destroy` command.

== Conclusion

We hope that this walkthrough has given you a good overview of K8up and its capabilities. But it can do much more than that! We haven't talked about the archive, prune, and check commands, or about the backup of any data piped to `stdout` (called "Application Aware" backups.) You can check these features in the https://k8up.io/[K8up documentation website] where they are described in detail.

K8up is still a work in progress, but it is already being used in production in many clusters. It is also an https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up[open source project], and everybody is welcome to use it freely, and even better, to contribute to it!
